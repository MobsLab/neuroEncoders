function [X1, Y1] = RemoveBadPosPoints2(X, Y, jump_thresh)
% [X1, Y1] = RemoveBadPosPoints2(X, Y, jump_thresh)
% removes bad points from Position tsd-s
% it works by smoothing by convolution the X position, and then
% elimintaing the points that are further from the smoothre trajectory
% than jump_thresh  
% INPUTS:
% X, Y: x and y coordinates tsd's (dirty)
% jump_thresh: threshold for jump, requires some trial and error,
% probably you want to use the minimum value that seems to work
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% X1, Y1: x and y coordinates tsd's (clean)
